# Memory Game Project

This game was built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The game is a simple application based on the mechanics and rules of the card game Concentration. This is the second project in the [Udacity Front-end Development Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001).

## How to Play the Game

The object of the game is to find all 8 matching pairs of cards using the least amount of moves possible. To get started, players will click any card to reveal its icon, then they will click any other card to try and find the matching icon. When a match is made, the cards will stay open. If no match is made, the icons will be hidden again, allowing the player to continue to try and find matches. Each move is counted and the less moves a player makes, the higher star rating they will have. The player can choose to start the game over at any time using the restart button.

Once all the matches have been made, a message will pop up alerting the player of their win. The message also includes player stats like star rating, total number of moves, and total play time in seconds.

This game is fully responsive and can be played on mobile devices, tablets, and desktops.
