## Description

This web-based game is based on the mechanics and rules of the card game Concentration. Users will click cards to find  matching pairs. There are 16 cards in total with 8 matching pairs. The user wins when they have successfully matched all 8 pairs.

Ways I plan to improve this project:
    * Add more unique styling to the cards and background
    * Add animations to successful and unsuccessful matches

## Dependencies

Card icons are from Font Awesome. Otherwise, there are no special dependencies.
